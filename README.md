- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShubhamGhalsasi2003  
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Machine Learning, and Open Source Contributions  
- 💻 Skills I have: Cloud Computing, Java, Machine Learning, MLOps, SQL , Oracle fusion (HCM,ERP,SC,CX)
- 💞️ I’m seeking to collaborate on innovative and scalable tech solutions, contribute to impactful projects in web development, machine learning, and cloud technologies, and engage in research or professional opportunities that drive digital transformation. I’m eager to join dynamic teams where I can apply my skills, grow as a developer and ML enthusiast, and solve real-world problems.
😄 Fun fact: I use Java to build, SQL to organize, MLOps to automate, and Cloud Computing to scale—but my real superpower is turning late-night debugging sessions into production-ready solutions
